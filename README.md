Challenge #9 - README.md Generator

## Task
- Create professional readme generator so that one can automatically build a readme just by using the command line.
- Use node.js and JavaScript to code a generator
- Ensure that the license has a badge and link, table of contents have directable link, questions section has a link to github profile and email.
- Sections to include: Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Process
- First we neeed to have node.js installed, and ensure inuquirer and file system dependencies are included.
- We need to code in JavaScript (2 files) to create the markdown generator and the index file
- In those files we need to create functions to render the license section, generate the markdown and then in the index create the questions prompt for the user to enter readme content, and functions to write the file.
- Once these are complete we can test it using node index.js, and this should start the prompt and then write the file.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to use node.js, including how to install a package like inquirer.
- I learned how node works with JavaScript, and that the JS is pretty much the same as normal with a few exceptions that are specific to node.
- I learned how to create a github license and link.
